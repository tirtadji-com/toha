## Usage

Run your hugo site with this theme.

```console
hugo server -w
```

Pull requests are most welcome and I will be happy to review. Just follow the following principles:

- Keep it simple.

- Have patience.

>I am not a web developer. I just created this theme for my personal needs. So, it is reasonable to have some flaws in the codes. Feel free to open issues and PR acknowledging the problems.

## Local Development

For local development, you can run your own site or the [example site](https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha-example-site) locally and make changes in the theme submodule.

### Fork
Fork [this repo](https://github.com/hossainemruz/toha) and setup your local submodule with the following from the site's folder by running the following

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
cd themes/toha
git remote add my-fork https://github.com/<your-github-user>/toha
git checkout -b my-feature-branch
```

From there you can make changes to the source code of the theme while testing with your running Hugo site.

### Open a PR

When the changes look good, commit and push them to your fork
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "A meaningful commit message"
git push my-fork my-feature-branch
```

And then open a PR `https://github.com/<your-github-user></your-github-user>/toha/pull/new/my-feature-branch`
